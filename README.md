**Project Description**

A technical documentation page for the Airbnb CSS/Sass Style Guide.

**Tools & Methods Used**

- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) (browser-sync, gulp-clean-css, gulp-rename)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

**Little Things I Learned**

- the CSS shorthand property `all`
- the CSS keyword `revert`
- the use of `all: revert` to reset all cascaded properties of an element
- using CSS Grid to change to a vertical nav bar layout

**Project Epilogue**

I came into this project thinking it would be very easy. While it was, overall, less design work and coding, there were some tricky layout and spacing problems.

Getting the vertical nav bar to take up the entire left side and have proper spacing took a bit of thought. I was able to utilize `grid-template-areas` which I had somewhat avoided until now. Turns out it's straightforward and made placing elements where I wanted them a breeze.

Overall, a simple and straightforward project where I learned a couple new tricks. :grin:
